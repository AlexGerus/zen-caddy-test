#### Nest + Prisma + Angular üèÆ Modern Full Stack SPA 

---

## üèØ Project Founders Notes

If I could be so humble as to mention a few things about myself. I have built 2 enterprise grade web portals utilizing Nest, Prisma, and Angular. This project is an attempt to package the sum total of all those lessons, and making it publicly available for the community.

What is really nice about Nest and Angular is that their programming idioms carry over between the two, allowing for front-end devs to contribute to the back-end.  Though, there are complexities in creating a GraphQL endpoint to expose CRUD operations over the data model to the client. If that piece of the problem could be solved, it would allow for anyone to be a full stack developer. A combination between Nest + Prisma + Angular has provided for new capabilities the industry has not really seen before.  This project code generates all the boilerplate required in bridging these 3 technologies together.

There is a tremendous amount of value to be gained by treating the `prisma.schema` file as the single source of truth, and then code generate everything else from that.  It guarantees consistency between the front-end and back-end.  It also centralizes the CRUD operations over all the projects Prisma models via a single import endpoint.  This project provides solutions for all the hardest parts of creating an enterprise grade web portal for you.

New contributors are welcome!

## ü•¢ GraphQL Features

- [x] [Nest GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers) resolvers as a gateway to [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/prisma-in-your-stack/graphql).
- [x] [Prisma to GraphQL SDL bindings](https://paljs.com/generator/sdl) generated via [Pal.js CLI](https://paljs.com/cli/generator)!  Thank you [**@AhmedElywa**](https://github.com/paljs) üéé
- [x] [Prisma Case Insensitive Filtering](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/case-sensitivity) For case-insensitive querying of text.
- [x] [PrismaSelect](https://paljs.com/plugins/select/) to solve the N+1 problem for all queries for free.
- [x] [PrismaDelete](https://paljs.com/plugins/delete) to add `CASCADE` and `SET_NULL` deletion capabilities to Prisma. These features have yet to be implemented by the core Prisma team. This project will convert to the approach directly supported by Prisma when the official feature becomes available.
- [x] Custom npm scripts to code generate the Nest GraphQL gateway on Prisma schema changes.
- [x] [Code generation](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-apollo-angular) of [apollo-angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/) services to enable simple, type safe access to the GraphQL API within Angular. üéÄ Modern dev tooling configured for the project, allowing for [Apollo extension for VS Code](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/) to provide autocompletion for GraphQL files that have a `.gql.ts` extension. 
- [x] An Angular `GraphQLModule` to simplify the configuration of the `ApolloClient` to enable/disable the varying `ApolloLink` features.
- [x] [HttpBatchLink](https://apollo-angular.com/docs/data/network#httpclient-1) for batching several GraphQL requests that occur within a short debounce interval. This really helps to alleviate network congestion.
- [x] [UploadLink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-upload-client) to give `ApolloClient` HTTP multi-part form requests capabilities. Enabling the uploading of files via `GraphQLUpload`.
- [x] [WebSocketLink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#2-initialize-a-websocketlink) for GraphQL subscriptions over websockets.

## üç± API Authentication, Performance & Scaling

- [X] [Nest authentication](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication), user creation, and login system designed specifically to work for an [Angular SPA (single page application)](https://angular.io/). This project will provide responsive, "mobile first" interfaces for the standard set of authentication features.
- [X] `New account component`
- [x] `Login component`
- [ ] `Forgot password component` and a pre-built password reset flow.
- [ ] `Password change component` for user dashboards (coming soon)
- [X] `Angular route guards` and `Angular directives` to show/hide content depending on user permissions.
- [X] [Nest authorization directives](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication#extending-guards) for server side [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control?oldformat=true) to allow for declarative, fine grained security control over all GraphQL queries and mutations.
- [x] 100% stateless web server authentication via [JWT (Javascript Web Tokens)](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication#jwt-functionality). Keeping the API stateless will enable horizontal scaling of container replicas in production.

## üçµ Modern Web Components and Responsive UIs

- [x] SASS chosen as the css transpiler of choice
- [x] [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) components & theme.
- [X] Mobile first approach to build the framework's core components (login form, etc).
- [x] Directly import [Bootstrap reset, utilities, & grid](https://www.amadousall.com/the-good-parts-of-bootstrap-4-you-are-missing-in-your-angular-material-projects/) features through SASS imports, and exclude the Bootstrap theme and component styles. These features are missing from Angular Material, and greatly simplify the creation of responsive, mobile first applications.

## üç• Project & Dev Tools

- [x] [Nx for project management](https://nx.dev/angular) to allow for the use of [Nx Console extensions for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console). Nx Console is a GUI interface for monorepos that adds a lot of modern developer conveniences. It also helps to simplify the use of the various Angular & Nest code generation schematics available in the ecosystem.
- [x] [Angular Language Service for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) for modern IDE tooling.
- [x] NPM scripts for versioned releases of the **api** server as a containerized Docker image. [node:14-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node?tab=description&ref=hackernoon.com) is used as the Docker container base image, and the appropriate `tsconfig.app.json` configurations are being applied for the Node v14 Nest app.
- [x] Enforced code formatting via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) & [import-sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-import-sort), guaranteeing all contributions to the project are standardized with predictable structure, and clear legibility.
- [X] [@nest-modules/mailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nest-modules/mailer) for automated emailing, and pre-configured [Handbars e-mail templates](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars) for the various web portal's emailing needs. Handlebars has similar double bracket `{{contextField}}` template interpolation, akin to Angular templates. Custom HTML e-mail triggers within Nest are made very simple by simply passing a JSON context and the template's name as paramaters to the class injectable `MailService`.  The [apps/api/src/app/mail/templates](https://github.com/ZenSoftware/Zen/tree/main/apps/api/src/app/mail/templates) directory is a **conventions first approach**, simplifying the management of e-mail templates.
- [x] [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) to generate Nest & Angular documentation.
